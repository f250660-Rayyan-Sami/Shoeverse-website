🛠 Core Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure, modals, product cards, layout
CSS3 – Neon dark theme, animations, responsive grid, hover effects
JavaScript (ES6+) – Product rendering, cart logic, scratch game, dynamic UI
All code is contained in one HTML file for this project (HTML + CSS + JS).

🚀 How It Works (Quick Technical Overview)
🔹 Product Rendering
Products are stored in a JavaScript array and dynamically injected into the grid using filterProducts().

🔹 Cart System
Items stored in a JS array
Total auto-calculated
Remove function updates UI live
Discount applied when scratch code is revealed
🔹 Scratch-to-Win Logic
Canvas overlay scratched using
globalCompositeOperation = 'destination-out'
Once enough area is scratched → 20% discount applies.

🔹 Modals
Reusable modal system using .modal-overlay.open.
